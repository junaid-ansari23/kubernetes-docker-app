# kubernetes-docker-app
A sample application to show how to build and deploy an application on kubernetes cluster. 
I have used the openshift container plateform for deploying ang running this application. You can check the kubernetes 
config and deployment files under keubernetes folder.Openshift provies a CLI to interact with cluster.
I have also included the commands to create deloyment config,service and routes.
